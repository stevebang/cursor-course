I want you to build this presentation as described by my course outline ./course_outline.md

It should contain all of the sections as described in this file.

You will look up and read through the cursor docs to make sure all of the things that we talk about the cursor editor are Up to date according to the cursor 2.0 documentation: https://cursor.com/docs

- Then I want you to integrate these notes ./cursor_for_staff_engineers.md as refrence for high level workflows on using cursor to build apps, no need to integrate all the suggestions, keep it focused on the contents of the course from the outline but integrate what makes sense from here that will add up to the contents of the course.
Then you can review the notes below containing suggestions for sources with notes for what is the information they contain so you can decide on which to use and how to use them. For pdfs, make sure to delgate their full processing to a specialized sub-agent that should return the relevant notes from the pdf that you should integrate into the presentation.

Make sure to use the remark slides skill and create all of the slides according to the course outline and integrating the notes and sources below as well as as whatever else you find relevant from web search that would make this course complete.

The final contents should saved into a presentation.html file with all the slides.

Notes:

<notes>
- we'll have one slide on creating architectural diagrams in cursor: https://cursor.com/docs/cookbook/mermaid-diagrams

- this file: ./complete_workflow_demos_for_full_buids_of_apps.md contains a transcript of a video describing entire workflows for building apps with cursor, could be a good reference with examples of how to setup workflows for building apps with cursor (as an example refrence, but should not be like the main workflow, just to keep in mind)

- survey of techniques and challenges for ai agentic programming in ./ai-agentic-programming.pdf

- interesting read regarding production framework to build with AI coding agents (like the ones in cursor)

- Here are prompting tips that could be in the course or not, review them to see if they make sense: ./prompting_tips.md

- Deploy option I'm thinking vercel

- Cool repo where they show how to reverse engineer apps with AI, we could use this as inspiration for some of the demos or usecases to showcase how to do it in cursor for small examples that might be relevant....: https://github.com/Integuru-AI/Integuru 

- Add a section on MCP servers

  - Github MCP Server

  - Cursor talk to figma mcp example for potential usecases where we want to show design/UI related workflows: https://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp

  - GitMCP to turn any github repo ito a remote mcp server: https://gitmcp.io/
