A guy from Reddit has been doing AI pair programming daily for 6 months and shared what ACTUALLY works 👇

Most developers are using AI like a glorified Google search. But this Redditor cracked the code on true AI pair programming - and his workflow is genius.

His 3-step system:

1. Central agent = project manager
-- Use Claude/GPT-4 to break projects into small tasks
-- Create a memory system logging every completion/bug
-- Prevents context drift that kills AI projects

2. Agent assembly line
-- Central agent creates task prompts for other AIs
-- Use fresh chat sessions with cheaper models (GPT-4 mini)
-- Each agent = ONE task with fresh context
-- Log everything back to central memory

3. Review loop
-- Central agent reviews completed tasks
-- Generates follow-ups for blocked items
-- Rinse and repeat

Why it works:
It eliminates context drift and AI hallucinations by distributing work across fresh instances. Each agent stays focused while a central memory system maintains project continuity.

Stop treating AI like a chatbot. Start treating it like a development team.
